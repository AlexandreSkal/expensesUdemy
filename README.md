# expensesUdemy

Project developed while following the course of Professor Leonardo Moura Leit√£o (Coder).

The project is designed for personal expense registration. With this project, we can register our expenses, and the application shows a weekly summary of the spending. Any spending outside the range of 7 days will not be displayed.

In Scaffold, we can register a new expense.

What I learned in developing this application until 01/09/2021:

Basic usage of both Stateless and Stateful Widgets.
- Create adaptive resources for Android and IOS.
- Everything is a Widget hehe.
- Basic responsiveness features.
- Create classes for resources that repeat in the application.

Several interesting resources were used in the application, but the ones listed above were the ones I learned the best.


Future improvements for the application:
- Create a feature to edit an already registered expense (currently the only option is to delete and register the expense again).
- Automatically delete expenses that are over 7 days old, since they don't make sense for this application.
